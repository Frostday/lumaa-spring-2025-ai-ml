# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

## Overview

The approach featurizes both user preferences and movie overviews using TF-IDF vectors. Recommendations are generated by calculating cosine similarity between the featurized representation of user preferences and movie overviews.

## Dataset

I used the movies dataset on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/movies-dataset (already provided inside `data/`)

## Setup

- Make your conda environment and activate it
```
conda create -n temp python=3.12
conda activate temp
```
- Download all the required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

- Run the Python file with user input as the first and number of recommendation as second argument, examples:
```
python recommend.py "I love thrilling action movies set in space, with a comedic twist."
python recommend.py "I enjoy historical romance genre." 10
```

## Results
